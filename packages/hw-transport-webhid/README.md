## @ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid

Allows to communicate with Ledger Hardware Wallets.

**[Web]** **(WebHID)** â€“ WebHID [check browser support](https://caniuse.com/webhid).

### FAQ: "DOM Exception" is triggered when creating the transport

The transport functions `create()` and `listen()` must be called in the context of an user interaction (like a **"click"** event), otherwise it fails with DOM Exception. This is by WebUSB design. You also must run on HTTPS.

### How to use this transport?

Please check `@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb` documentation because it is very similar paradigm.

### Support status

WebUSB is currently only supported on Google Chrome / Chromium DEV version and by explicitly enabling `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`
